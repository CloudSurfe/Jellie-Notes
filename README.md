JellyNotes is a smart, open-source task and note management app built by the [**CloudSurfe**](https://www.cloudsurfe.com) team. Designed to be both intuitive and powerful, it helps you stay organized, focused, and in control — whether you're capturing ideas, planning your day, or managing complex workflows. With features like intelligent reminders, recurring tasks, voice-to-text input, natural language parsing, and AI-driven prioritization, JellyNotes adapts to how you think. It’s more than a to-do list — it’s where your thoughts turn into action.

> **Currently available on Android**. iOS support is planned for a future release.
